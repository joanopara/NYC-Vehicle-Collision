# Technical-Project-1

With the high number of pedestrians and the heavily congested roads in a densely populated area like New
York City, this results to a lot of traffic accidents. This project attempts to conduct a descriptive and diagnostic data
analysis to find factors which influence and cause an exponential increase in the occurrence of vehicle collisions yearly.
I have performed some data mining techniques and applied two different clustering algorithms to help identify the areas
with the most occurring accidents, the most common reasons for these accidents, and the group of people commonly
involved in the accidents.
